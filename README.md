# Hello-World
Place for new developer to store ideas, resources
I woke up from a three year bender in a fraternity house of an elite university I don't attend
Currently I'm living in their basement - my room is pretty damn cozy to be honest, things could be much worse
I dropped out of college because of an intense fear of debt-slavery. I grew up poor and owing people money. Not doing it again.
SO I'm living in the fraternity house and teaching myself to code in the basement. I need some marketable skills, and I dream of working remotely from a bungalow or something.
Might take some time. Definitely requires work. I know that I am capable of this. I know that I can excel and prosper.
